# Introduction
This is a template for a machine learning project structure. 
It is designed to help you organize your project in a clean and efficient way. 
The template includes directories for raw and processed data, notebooks, scripts, utilities, models, configuration files, requirements, tests, and results. 
It also provides a sample directory structure and descriptions for each directory.

If you are a beginner in machine learning, this template will help you get started with your project.
If you are an experienced data scientist, you can use this template as a starting point and customize it according to your needs.

# Getting Started
To get started with this template, follow these steps:
clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:HuimingPan/MachineLearningProjectTemplate.git
```

Open the project directory and start customizing the template according to your project requirements.

In this README.md, you can provide an overview of your project, describe the project structure, and list the tasks that need to be completed.
For example, you can list the following tasks:
# To-do
- [ ] An example task to be completed.

You can also provide instructions on how to run the project, install dependencies, and run tests. 

# Project Structure
The project structure is designed to keep your code organized and modular.
It includes the following directories:
```plaintext
ProjectName/
|-- data/
|   |-- raw/
|   |-- processed/
|-- notebooks/
|-- utilities/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- config.py
|   |-- data/
|   |-- dataset/
|   |-- features/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- evaluation/
|   |-- visualization/
|-- models/
|   |-- trained_model.pkl
|-- config/
|   |-- config.ini
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
|-- scripts/
|   |-- train_model.py
|   |-- predict.py
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- results/
|   |-- evaluation_results.txt
```

### Directory Descriptions:

- **data/raw:** Raw data files, typically in their original form.
- **data/processed:** Processed and cleaned datasets for training and testing.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model training.
- **scripts:** Standalone scripts for tasks like training the model and making predictions.
- **utilities**: Python modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
  - **data/**: subpackage for data loading and preprocessing.
  - **dataset/**: subpackage for dataset creation.
  - **features/**: subpackage for feature engineering.
  - **models/**: subpackage for model instantiation.
  - **evaluation/**: subpackage for model evaluation.
  - **visualization/**: subpackage for visualization.
  - **config.py:** Python module for reading configuration parameters.
- **models:** Saved trained models.
- **config:** Configuration files.
  - **config.ini:** Configuration parameters for the project.
- **tests:** Unit tests for the source code.
- **docs:** Additional project documentation, such as API references or detailed explanations.
- **results:** Output files or logs from model evaluation.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
