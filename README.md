# Introduction
This is a template for a machine learning project structure. 
It is designed to help you organize your project in a clean and efficient way. 
The template includes directories for raw and processed data, notebooks, scripts, utilities, models, configuration files, requirements, tests, and results. 
It also provides a sample directory structure and descriptions for each directory.

# Project Structure
The project structure is designed to keep your code organized and modular.
It includes the following directories:
```plaintext
ProjectName/
|-- data/
|   |-- raw/
|   |-- processed/
|-- notebooks/
|-- utilities/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- config.py
|   |-- data/
|   |-- dataset/
|   |-- features/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- evaluation/
|   |-- visualization/
|-- models/
|   |-- trained_model.pkl
|-- config/
|   |-- config.ini
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
|-- scripts/
|   |-- train_model.py
|   |-- predict.py
|-- tests/
|-- docs/
|-- results/
|   |-- evaluation_results.txt
```

### Directory Descriptions:

- **data/raw:** Raw data files, typically in their original form.
- **data/processed:** Processed and cleaned datasets for training and testing.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model training.
- **scripts:** Standalone scripts for tasks like training the model and making predictions.
- **utilities**: Python modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
  - **data/**: subpackage for data loading and preprocessing.
  - **dataset/**: subpackage for dataset creation.
  - **features/**: subpackage for feature engineering.
  - **models/**: subpackage for model instantiation.
  - **evaluation/**: subpackage for model evaluation.
  - **visualization/**: subpackage for visualization.
  - **config.py:** Python module for reading configuration parameters.
- **models:** Saved trained models.
- **config:** Configuration files.
  - **config.ini:** Configuration parameters for the project.
- **tests:** Unit tests for the source code.
- **docs:** Additional project documentation, such as API references or detailed explanations.
- **results:** Output files or logs from model evaluation.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
